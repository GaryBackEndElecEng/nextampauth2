## summary

The average temperature rise over the measured 174 years is a positive 0.054 <sup>degrees</sup> per year compounded. This means that the total sum of the rise over 174 years is 0.054(1+0.054/174)<sup>^174</sup>=1.05547 total accumulated increase in degrees ( including the temperature decrease before 1937). This does not take into consideration the drastic change in temperature increase from 1937.

At present,the gradient ( the overall slope) is 0.006 <sup>degrees</sup><sub>/year</sub>. We have doubled our temperature rate since 1977. This dramatic increase is directly proportional to global oil production.

In all, 1946 and 1976 sparked a global market boom. Technology has increased the efficiency of oil extransaction as well as manufacturing which lead to lowering global product unit price.

### Year 1937

global warming increase started in 1937. 1937 summary events:

- there was the start of the spanish Civil War,( Battle of Jarama);
- Nylon was invented;
- Uk bought its first Japanese-built aircraft to fly to Europe;
- Ground test for the world's first jet-engine;
- The Hindenburg bursts into flames over Lakehurst, New Jersey USA;
- Italy massacred an entire town of Debre Libanos, killing 297 monks and 23 laymen;
- Picasso completed his painting of Gernica;
- The first total solar eclipse to exceed 7 minutes of totality, in over 800 years over the Pacific and Peru;
- Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappear after taking off from New Guinea, during Earhart's attempt to become the first woman to fly around the world;
- Japanese and Chinese forces exchange fire near Beijing - beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War;
- The operation for repression of former kulaks, criminals and other anti-Soviet elements"), approved the Politburo of the Soviet Union, to execute 75,950 people and an additional 193,000 to be sent to the Gulag;
- Japan occupied Beijing;
- The Battle of Shanghai starts;
- Great Hong Kong Typhoon kills an estimated 11,000 persons;
- The Communist Chinese Eighth Route Army defeats the Japanese;
- The Marihuana Tax Act becomes law in the United States;
- Dominican troops kill thousands of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic;
- Ernest Hemingway's novel To Have and Have Not is first published in the United States;
- Initialized World War II: In the Reich Chancellery, Adolf Hitler holds a secret meeting and states his plans for acquiring "living space" for the German people;
- The Kogushi Sulfur Mine collapse, in western Gunma, Japan, killing 245 people;
- The Battle of Nanking ends with the Japanese occupying the city;
- Nanking Massacre: Japanese soldiers killed over 300,000 Chinese in 3 months;
- Nationalist government of China moved its capital to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing); and
- The new Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht) comes into force leading to the first President of Ireland in June 1938 to be elected.

### Year: 1941- major increase in Global warming

The Correlates of War project estimates this to be the deadliest year in human history in these terms of conflict deaths, placing the death toll at 3.49 million. However, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program estimates that the subsequent year, 1942, was the deadliest such year. Death toll estimates for both 1941 and 1942 range from 2.28 to 7.71 million each

### conclusion

At the rate of global temperature and sea-level rise, leading to increasing animal extinctions, what will we leave our kids with? - something to think about while we curb CO<sup>2</sub> emissions before its too late.

Runaway global temperature rise, due to global feedbacks, starts in 20-50 years.
